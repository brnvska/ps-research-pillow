### Student\`s research "Human Stress Detection in and through Sleep by monitoring physiological data."

Analysing data from
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laavanya/human-stress-detection-in-and-through-sleep?select=SaYoPillow.csv>
and predicting how different indicators affect the quality of our sleep.

#### Data overview

```{r}
pillow <- read.csv(file = 'C:/Users/baran/Desktop/data_for_research.csv')
pillow
```

Dataset includes information about every participant and their sleep
indicators: snoring rate, sleeping hour (\>= 2), heart rate, stress
level. Our aim is to find how these indicators affect each other and
whether there is a certain correlation or dependence between them.
